# Which cookies to accept. With QtWebEngine, this setting also controls
# other features with tracking capabilities similar to those of cookies;

# AppCache. Note that with QtWebKit, only `all` and `never` are
# supported as per-domain values. Setting `no-3rdparty` or `no-
# unknown-3rdparty` per-domain on QtWebKit will have the same effect as
# `all`. If this setting is used with URL patterns, the pattern gets
# applied to the origin/first party URL of the page making the request,
# not the request URL. With QtWebEngine 5.15.0+, paths will be stripped
# from URLs, so URL patterns using paths will not match. With
# QtWebEngine 5.15.2+, subdomains are additionally stripped as well, so
# you will typically need to set this setting for `example.com` when the
# cookie is set on `somesubdomain.example.com` for it to work properly.
# To debug issues with this setting, start qutebrowser with `--debug
# --logfilter network --debug-flag log-cookies` which will show all
# cookies being set.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - all: Accept all cookies.
#   - no-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only. This is known to break some sites, such as GMail.
#   - no-unknown-3rdparty: Accept cookies from the same origin only, unless a cookie is already set for the domain. On QtWebEngine, this is the same as no-3rdparty.
#   - never: Don't accept cookies at all.

# `{}` and `{semiquoted}` quote everything except slashes; this is the
# most   sensible choice for almost all search engines (for the search
# term   `slash/and&amp` this placeholder expands to `slash/and%26amp`).

# placeholder   expands to `slash%2Fand%26amp`). * `{unquoted}` quotes
# nothing (for `slash/and&amp` this placeholder   expands to
# `slash/and&amp`). * `{0}` means the same as `{}`, but can be used
# multiple times.  The search engine named `DEFAULT` is used when
# `url.auto_search` is turned on and something else than a URL was
# entered to be opened. Other search engines can be used by prepending
# the search engine name to the search term, e.g. `:open google
